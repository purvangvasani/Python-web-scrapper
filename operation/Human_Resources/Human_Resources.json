When a workteam member is deleted, it is as if they were never a member and their                  entire membership status history is also deleted. If you want to retain membership                  status history after a member departs, Workday recommends that you change the member's                  status to Inactive instead.                                    When a worker does not exist as a workteam member as of the specified effective date,                  they are added as a member with the specified effective date and membership status.                  When a worker does exist as a workteam member as of the specified effective date,                  the operation updates their membership status. You can correct a membership status                  by using the same effective date as an existing membership status snapshot or correct                  the membership status to an earlier effective date by specifying the desired effective                  date and the same membership status as the next effective-dated snapshot.                                    Example: Membership status is Passive with effective date December 1, 2018. If you                  specify November 15, 2018 as the effective date and membership status as Passive,                  the system will change the effective date on the December 1, 2018 snapshot to November                  15, 2018. If a workteam member is added too early, you can either delete the member                  entirely and add them again, or correct the membership status of the first snapshot                  to be Inactive and then add a new snapshot with the correct effective date and a membership                  status of Active or Passive.
