One row for each Effective Date, Unit of Measure, and Just In Time=(1 or 0)  combination that exists.2. If you want to inactivate a Supplier Item for a specific date in the future, you must send a Supplier Item Unit of Measure Data for every Unit of Measure used by that Supplier Item, using that same (future) Effective Date and marked Inactive=1 and default=0. If there are Just In Time Units of Measure, additional rows must be sent to inactivate those as well.Similarly, if there is pricing data already saved for the Supplier Item for any other date(s) after that future date, you must send rows for those date(s), inactivating and setting them as non-default.3. You must also mark all of its Advanced Pricing rules for the affected dates (if any) inactive, or else errors will occur.5. If you are not using the supplier item in the future, it is strongly recommended to also set the Sourcing Priority to 0 at that time so the Sourcing Priority number is available for another Supplier.", "validation": [{"validation": "Enter a Supplier Contract that is approved.\u00a0", "description": "This validation is ignored if for a Catalog Item, since any Supplier Contracts entered in payload are ignored.\u00a0"}, {"validation": "Enter a Valid and Unique Manufacturer ID for the Purchase Item.\u00a0", "description": "\u00a0"}, {"validation": "Enter a Manufacturer.
